<!-- Basic Forms Notes -->

<!-- Largely based on the input types -->

<!-- type="email" is great for validations -->
<!-- type="color" brings a pop up that allows you to pick a color-->

    <!-- Example -->
    <form>
        <h1>Log In</h1>
        <h2>Please Input your Email and Password</h2>

        <input type="email" name="useremail">
        <input type="password" name="userpassword">
        <input type="submit" value="submit">
    </form>

<!-- Forms and Labels Notes -->

<!-- To prevent the refresh, type an action into the form tag and the method -->

<!-- The better way to label is to use the label tag and the for attribute -->

<!-- Passing an attribute of required helps with validations as well -->
