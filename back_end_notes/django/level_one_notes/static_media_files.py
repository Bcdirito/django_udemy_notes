# Static File Notes

# Very similiar creation to templates file
# {% %} for more complex injections and logic

# Any file that isn't going to change
# Can include CSS files

# add {% load staticfiles %} at top of template to be able to call static files

# to reference file -> {% static "relative_file_path"%}
